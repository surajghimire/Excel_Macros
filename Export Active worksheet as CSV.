Prepare a macro to write a sheet named "abc"  as a csv file named "pqr.csv" in the folder "Desktop/suraj"


Sub ExportABCAsCSV()
    Dim FilePath As String
    Dim ABCSheet As Worksheet
    
    'Set the path to save the file
    FilePath = Environ("USERPROFILE") & "\Desktop\suraj\pqr.csv"
    
    'Disable display alerts and screen updating
    Application.DisplayAlerts = False
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    
    'Check if a worksheet named "abc" exists
    On Error Resume Next
    Set ABCSheet = Worksheets("abc")
    If ABCSheet Is Nothing Then
        MsgBox "Worksheet ""abc"" not found!", vbCritical
        Exit Sub
    End If
    
    'Copy the "abc" worksheet to a new workbook
    ABCSheet.Copy
    Set NewWB = ActiveWorkbook
    
    'Save the new workbook as CSV
    With NewWB
        .SaveAs Filename:=FilePath, FileFormat:=xlCSV, Local:=True
        .Close SaveChanges:=False
    End With
    
    'Re-enable display alerts and screen updating
    Application.DisplayAlerts = True
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
    
    MsgBox "Worksheet ""abc"" exported to " & FilePath, vbInformation
